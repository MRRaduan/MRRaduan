# Hi there! :coffee:

I'm Matheus Raduan from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· and I solve problems by design and building web experiences.

*i.e. a developer with a focus on **Frontend** and **Design**.* :nerd_face:

## How I face the *work*

I believe that we always work for someone and the Person I work for is bigger than my own work.
The question you should ask me is: who do you work for?

## Things I like

- Coffee
- Books - mainly theological ones
- Cycling - I'm a bike commuter :bike:
- Rubik's cube - My official WCA single record in 3x3x3 is 34.25s
- Be in communion with my brothers - *[SIBS & Unijovem](https://www.instagram.com/unijovemsibs/)*
