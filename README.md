# Hi there! :coffee:

My name is ~~Matheus~~ Raduan but everybody calls me Raduan. I'm from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· and I solve problems by design and building web experiences.

*i.e. a developer with a focus on **Frontend** and **Design**.* :nerd_face:

 I've been working as Frontend Developer at a fintech of the group [Movile](https://www.movile.com.br/) called MovilePay that delivers delightful experiences to payment and food market, along with [iFood](https://www.ifood.com.br/). *#FasterTogether*

## How I face the *work*

I believe that the Person who I work for is bigger than my own work.
The question you should be asking is: who do I work for?
