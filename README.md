# Hi there!

My name is ~~Matheus~~ Raduan but everybody calls me Raduan. I'm from Brazil and I solve problems by design and building web experiences.
*i.e. a developer with a focus on Frontend and Design.*
 I've been working as Frontend Developer at a fintech called MovilePay that delivers delightful experiences to payment and food market, along with iFood. #FasterTogether

I like coffee, books, cycling, rubik's cube and be in communion with my brothers.

## How I face the *work*

I believe that the Person who I work for is bigger than my own work.
The question you should be asking is, who do you work for?
