# Hi there! :coffee:

I'm Matheus Raduan from Brazil 🇧🇷 and I solve problems by design and building web experiences.

*i.e. a developer with a focus on **Frontend** and **Design**.* :nerd_face:

## How I face the *work*

I believe that we always work for someone
and the Person that I work for is bigger than my own work.

The question you should ask me is: who do you work for?

## Things I like

- Coffee ☕
- Play bass guitar 🎸
- Read and study 📚
- Gym 🏋🏽
- Rubik's cube - [My official WCA single record in 3x3x3](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2012RADU02) is 34.15s
- Be in communion with my brothers - *[SIBS & Unijovem](https://www.instagram.com/unijovemsibs/)*
